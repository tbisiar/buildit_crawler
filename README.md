# buildit_crawler
A simple web crawler.  Given a domain url it should visit all pages within the domain, but not follow the links to external sites such as Google or Twitter

## TODO

[] Add tests

[] Expand scraper to follow same-domain links

[] Validate behavior and add more tests (may need to switch to selenium)

[] Dockerize

[] Async

[] Resiliancy

* memory & performance

* logging

* case sensitivity

[] Review and update README.md
